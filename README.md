# LUCID: Lightweight Unified Classifier for Intrusion Detection (Optimized)

LUCID is an optimized deep learning framework designed for real-time detection of DDoS attacks in network traffic. Originally proposed by Doriguzzi-Corin et al. (2020), this fork builds on their work and incorporates a set of targeted enhancements developed. These optimizations aim to reduce latency, overhead, and maintain high detection accuracy.

**Disclaimer**: This repository is a derivative of the original LUCID system. Proper credit is given below. The enhancements are part of an independent academic research project.

## Features & Optimizations

| # | Optimization              | Description                                                                 |
|---|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | Optimized CNN Architecture | Uses `SeparableConv2D`, `BatchNormalization`, and `GlobalAveragePooling2D`. |
| 2 | Efficient Data Preprocessing | Speeds up PCAP parsing using `multiprocessing.Pool` and `joblib` caching.  |
| 3 | Hyperparameter Tuning     | Applies `RandomizedSearchCV` for optimizing LR, batch size, dropout, etc.  |
| 4 | Model Quantization        | Converts `.h5` models to `.tflite` for faster inference and smaller size.  |
| 5 | Threaded Live Prediction  | Captures and classifies packets in real-time using parallel threads.       |
| 6 | Colorized Output + Logging | Uses ANSI colors for terminal output and logs all predictions to file.     |

## Setup Instructions


This will:

Train the CNN using the optimized architecture

Tune hyperparameters using RandomizedSearchCV

Apply early stopping and save the best model

Quantize the best model to .tflite

Saved models are located in ./output/.

Predict from Live Traffic
```
python --predict_live --model ./output/best_model.tflite
```



## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/lucid.git
cd lucid
```

2. Install Dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Prepare Dataset
Place your .pcap or .hdf5 training files into the data/ directory.
Use utils/data_preprocessing.py to convert raw PCAPs if needed.

5. Train the Model
```
python lucid_cnn.py --train --dataset ./data/train.hdf5
```

This command will:

* Train the CNN using the optimized architecture defined in `utils/model_architectures.py`.
* Tune hyperparameters using `RandomizedSearchCV` for optimal performance.
* Apply early stopping to prevent overfitting and save the best model.
* Quantize the best trained model to a `.tflite` format for efficient inference.

Saved Keras models and their quantized `.tflite` versions, along with training logs, will be located in the `./output/` directory.

## ðŸ§ª Predict from Live Traffic
bash python live_predict.py --model ./output/best_model.tflite
This script performs:

* Real-time packet sniffing from your network interface.
* Threaded prediction of potential DDoS attacks using the provided quantized `.tflite` model.
* Clear, colored console output indicating the classification of each processed packet.
* Detailed logging of predictions to `output/prediction_log.txt`.

## Example Output
Example Output

## Tips & Troubleshooting

* **Dataset Class Balance:** Ensure your training dataset has a balanced representation of normal and attack traffic. Consider techniques like:
    * Undersampling the majority class.
    * Applying SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) for minority oversampling.
    * Using class weights during training to account for imbalances.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** If you adapt Lucid to a new dataset or deployment environment, you might need to re-tune the hyperparameters in `lucid_cnn.py` for optimal performance.
* **Model Selection:** Experiment with different CNN architectures in `utils/model_architectures.py` to find the best fit for your specific needs and resource constraints.
